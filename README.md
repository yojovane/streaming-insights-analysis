ðŸŽ¬ Streaming Insights | User Behavior Analysis on Streaming Platforms
Project Overview
High consumption does not always equal high satisfaction â€” streaming platforms face significant content abandonment, especially for long-form titles and on mobile devices. This project analyzes user behavior to reveal when and why sessions drop, which experiences drive completion, and how device, plan, and time of day impact engagement.
The business objective is to reduce churn and increase engagement through actionable, data-driven recommendations. All deliverables are designed to be recruiter-friendly and showcase a complete junior Data Analyst workflow (NYC / Remote US focus).

Tools & Technologies
Python 3.10

Jupyter Notebook

pandas, numpy

seaborn, matplotlib

(Optional) plotly, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Tableau/Power BI

Data Structure
The project uses a simulated (or public) dataset of approximately 10,000 rows, designed to represent realistic streaming consumption sessions.

Key columns:

user_id â€” unique user identifier

content_type â€” {series, movie, documentary}

duration_minutes, watched_minutes

device_type â€” {mobile, tv, desktop, tablet}

watch_date (YYYY-MM-DD), start_time (HH:MM:SS)

age_group, region, user_plan â€” {free, basic, premium}

The synthetic generator encodes business-realistic patterns: mobile penalty on long content (>45 min), high completion for short documentaries (<30 min), engagement drop at ~10â€“11 PM, and lower average completion for the free plan.

Methodology
Data loading & cleaning â€” import CSV or generate synthetic dataset with embedded business patterns.

Feature engineering â€” create completion_rate, start_hour, and long_session flags.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” analyze patterns by content type, device, time of day, and subscription plan.

(Optional) Light modeling â€” run basic statistical checks to validate observed patterns.

Insights extraction â€” quantify factors driving higher or lower completion.

Actionable recommendations â€” propose tactics to improve KPIs (completion rate, session length, retention).

Key Findings & Insights
All metrics are calculated and stored in reports/summary.md when the notebook is run. Example findings:

Mobile vs TV (long content) â€” measured completion-rate penalty for mobile on content >45 minutes.

Short documentaries â€” highest average completion rate for <30-minute titles.

Lowest engagement window â€” 10â€“11 PM, especially for the free plan, shows a consistent dip.

See "Key Insights" in reports/summary.md for actual values from your dataset.

Business Recommendations
Evening programming: Serve shorter content in low-engagement hours; reprioritize recommendations after 10 PM.

Mobile long-form optimization: Improve resume points, offline viewing, and adaptive streaming to mitigate mobile drop-off.

Plan-aware engagement: Target free users with lightweight, high-completion content and upgrade incentives.

Continuous testing: Run A/B tests on recommendation algorithms and "watch next" prompts for low-completion cohorts.
